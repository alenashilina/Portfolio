The code in here is implementation of my *["Comparison of the Performance of Different Deep Neural Network Models Fitted to Olivetti Dataset" assignment](https://github.com/alenashilina/Portfolio/tree/Ingredients-CV-project/School%20assignments/Classification%202018-1%20TF)* for the school subject "Artificial Intelligence" (2018-1) in Tensorflow 2. I followed the same architectures and settings as in the assignment. The code is written in educational purposes to practice Tensorflow 2.
