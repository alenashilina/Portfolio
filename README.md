# Machine Learning portfolio
This is the repository containing different Machine Learning related projects I accomplished as part of my graduate school studying or as personal projects. These projects were made with a purpose to understand or practice certain Machine Learning/Deep learning concepts.

# Contents
- [**Ingredients detection** project](https://github.com/alenashilina/Portfolio/tree/Ingredients-CV-project/Ingredients%20detection). In this project I use computer vision principles to perform object localization. I localize ingredients section on labels on Korean food products.

- [**School assignments**](https://github.com/alenashilina/Portfolio/tree/Ingredients-CV-project/School%20assignments). The current section contains projects I accomplished as assignments for classes I attended while getting my Master degree. Projects folders contain code as well as written reports. Tackled problems include:

    * [Classification 2018-1](https://github.com/alenashilina/Portfolio/tree/Ingredients-CV-project/School%20assignments/Classification%202018-1%20TF) (Tensorflow 1.x)
 
    * [Classification 2018-1](https://github.com/alenashilina/Portfolio/tree/Ingredients-CV-project/School%20assignments/Classification%202018-1%20sklearn%20keras) (Scikit-learn, Keras)
    
    * [Clustering 2018-1](https://github.com/alenashilina/Portfolio/tree/Ingredients-CV-project/School%20assignments/Clustering%202018-1%20sklearn) (Scikit-learn)
    
    * [Regression 2018-1](https://github.com/alenashilina/Portfolio/tree/Ingredients-CV-project/School%20assignments/Regression%202018-1%20sklearn) (Scikit-learn)
    
    * [Wordcloud 2018-2](https://github.com/alenashilina/Portfolio/tree/Ingredients-CV-project/School%20assignments/Wordcloud%202018-2%20R) (R)
    
- [**Summarization with clustering**](https://github.com/alenashilina/Portfolio/tree/Ingredients-CV-project/Summarization%20with%20clustering). This section includes a small project the main idea of which is to summarize Korean texts embedded with BERT using K-means clustering algorithm.

- [**Tensorflow 2 practice**](https://github.com/alenashilina/Portfolio/tree/Ingredients-CV-project/Tensorflow%202%20practice). This section includes projects accomplished to practice Tensorflow 2 framework.
